Place a small, license-free MP4 named exactly "sample.mp4" in this folder.

Why:
- The app can use this bundled video for offline/local playback testing.
- Keeps testing predictable without relying on device storage or network.

Guidelines:
- Keep the file small (<2 MB).
- Ensure the format is MP4 (H.264/AAC typical).
- Rebuild the app after adding the file so it gets packaged into the APK.
